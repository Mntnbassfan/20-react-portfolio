      <p>
            Having experience as a former professional musician performing as a
            Tuba player in various symphony orchestras and theme parks and
            freelance Bass player, I understand the need of online presence for
            the promotion of the working professional musician and specialize in
            the development of custom websites and online web applications to
            assist these talented individuals with maximizing bookings and
            greatly increasing their performance opportunities.
